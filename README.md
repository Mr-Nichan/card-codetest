## Introduction
Setting up the project I first need to think about the choice of technology and then the CLI part. I'm thinking about picking Java or python for this since that lends itself very well to these types of applications. But I havent coded in either Java nor Python in quite some time and the packaging to ease of use is e bit cumbersome compared to just using node.

Then I start thinking about how to make it as easy as possible to accept user input through a CLI and so I wont have to spend too much time building the interaction part of it all.

A quick google search and I find some promising libraries that are tried and true. Inquirer and Commander was the two most popular I found. I opted for using Inquirer even though it was not as popular (in terms of weekly downloads) since it looked simpler to get into in the time span of this challenge and I didn't need the additional bells and whistles that came with Commander.
